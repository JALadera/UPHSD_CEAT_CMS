# UPH Engineering CMS - Session 2 Final Report

**Date:** April 6, 2026  
**Duration:** ~4 hours  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE & PRODUCTION READY

---

## 🎯 Session 2 Objectives - All Completed

### Primary Goals
- ✅ Fix ParseError in welcome.blade.php
- ✅ Reverse color scheme (white prominent, maroon boxes, yellow highlights)
- ✅ Implement carousel functionality
- ✅ Generate test data for all entities
- ✅ Ensure all pages render correctly

### Secondary Goals
- ✅ Migrate from MySQL to SQLite for easier development
- ✅ Fix factory enum constraint violations
- ✅ Add HasFactory trait to all models
- ✅ Create comprehensive test data seeder
- ✅ Build and optimize CSS

---

## 📋 Issues Fixed

### 1. ParseError in welcome.blade.php (Line 161)
**Issue:** `SyntaxError: Unexpected "endif"` - Missing footer closing tag
**Solution:** Added proper `</footer>` tag before closing `</body>`
**Impact:** Homepage now renders without errors

### 2. Database Connection Issues
**Issue:** MySQL credentials not matching environment
**Solution:** Migrated to SQLite for development (`database/database.sqlite`)
**Impact:** Faster setup, easier testing, no external dependencies needed

### 3. Model Factory Support
**Issue:** `Call to undefined method App\Models\Department::factory()`
**Solution:** Added `use HasFactory;` trait to all models
**Files Updated:** Department.php, Program.php, Course.php, FacultyMember.phpCenter.php, NewsEvent.php
**Impact:** Factories now work correctly for seeding

### 4. Enum Constraint Violations
**Issue:** CHECK constraint failed for `degree_level` and `semester` columns
**Root Cause:** Factory default values didn't match database enum values

**Enum Corrections:**
```
ProgramFactory:
  degree_level: ['bs', 'ms', 'mengg', 'de', 'phd', 'diploma']
  
CourseFactory:
  semester: ['1st', '2nd', 'summer', 'all']
  year_level: [1, 2, 3, 4] (integer, not string)
```

**Files Updated:** ProgramFactory.php, CourseFactory.php
**Impact:** Test data generation now succeeds without constraint violations

### 5. Str Facade Import
**Issue:** `Str::limit()` undefined in welcome.blade.php carousel
**Solution:** Added `use Illuminate\Support\Str;` at top of @php block
**Impact:** Carousel description text properly truncated

---

## 🎨 Features Implemented

**Database Integration:**
```php
$newsItems = App\Models\NewsEvent::where('is_published', true)
    ->orderBy('published_at', 'desc')
    ->limit(5)
    ->get()
    ->map(fn($item) => [
        'title' => $item->title,
        'description' => Str::limit($item->description, 100),
        'image' => $item->featured_image ?? 'https://...',
        'link' => route('view.news.show', $item->slug),
        'badge' => $item->is_event ? '📅 Event' : '📰 News',
    ])
    ->toArray();

// Fallback to demo items if no real data exists
if (empty($newsItems)) {
    $newsItems = [ /* 3 demo carousel items */ ];
}
```

**Alpine.js Component:**
